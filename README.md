// Bomb Defuse Experiment
// You need an Arduino, a red LED, an LCD, wires, a buzzer, and creativity.
// In my project, the wire connected to pin 4 is the one that saves the day.
// If you have free pins on your board, add some dummy wires and turn it into a game.
// I used Unreal Engine to add the explosion effect, but you could also build a game that links the physical and digital.
